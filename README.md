A SIMPLE TEST COMPLETION/EDITING/AUTO-CORRECTION TOOL 
=============

This is part of the projects I am currently undertaking in learning Go.

The programs receives as arguments the name of a file containing a text that needs modifications (the input) and the name of the file that that the modified text is placed in (the output)

`go run . sample.txt result.txt`

Guidelines to follow

- The project is written in Go
- The code respects the [good practices.](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/good-practices/README.md)
- There are test files for [unit testing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test).
